# Project 1: Unsupervised learning
The overall objective is to use unsupervised learning techniques to make a exploration of the data and to extract conclusions from relevant variables, discarded elements, etc.

The specific objectives are as follows:
1. Identification of outliers elements (teams) in the dataset.
2. Use clustering algorithms to identify groups and characterize them.
3. (optional) Feature Selection using clustering algorithms.

The data used correspond to statistics from the countries participating in the 2018 World Cup in Russia. 

# Project 2: Supervised learning
The overall objective is to use supervised learning techniques to predict the level of damage to buildings caused by the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal.
The dataset mainly consists of information on the buildingsâ€™ structure and their legal ownership.

# Project 3: Natural language processing
The aim of this project is to analyze a collection about comments on purchases about drinkable and edible products.
