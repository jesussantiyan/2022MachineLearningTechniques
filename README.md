# Project 1: Unsupervised learning
The overall objective is to use unsupervised learning techniques to make a preliminary exploration of the data and to extract conclusions from relevant variables, discarded elements, etc
The specific objectives are as follows:
1. Identification of outliers elements (teams) in the dataset.
2. Use clustering algorithms to identify groups and characterize them.
3. (optional) Feature Selection using clustering algorithms.

The data used correspond to statistics from the countries participating in the 2018 World Cup in Russia.
